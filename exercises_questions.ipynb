    " * Each cell can be executed by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. \n",

    "This exercise sheet is divided into four parts as follows. In the first three you get to work on some exercises that highlight some of the ways one can query and mine the ALMA Science Archive. In the last part, you get to work on your own research problem and we are happy to help you with your specific case. Feel free to jump between topics and use the allotted time as it is most efficient for you.\n",

    "pyVO is a python Virtual Observatory (VO) package that is designed for searching and accessing data from archives that use VO standards. Although astroquery can also be used within python to query the ALMA archive, pvVO is the only python tool that is officially supported by the ALMA archive developers.\n",

    "The package can be installed using `pip install pyvo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Searching by various parameters (including target position, frequency, and polarization).\n",
